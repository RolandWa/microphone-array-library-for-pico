# microphone-array-library-for-pico

Raspberry pi pico library for 6+1 microphone array connection.

Capture audio from a microphone array on your [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-pico/) or any [RP2040](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/rp2040/) based board. ðŸŽ¤


## Hardware

 * RP2040 board
   * [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-pico/)
 * Microphone array
   * [6+1 Microphone Array] (https://www.dfrobot.com/product-1976.html)

### Default Pinout

| Raspberry Pi Pico / RP2040 | Microphone | Configuration Define |
| -------------------------- | ----------------- |
| MIC_CK | 0 | PIN_SCK |
| MIC_WS | 1 | PIN_WS = PIN_SCK + 1 |
| MIC_D0 | 2 | PIN_SD0 |
| MIC_D1 | 3 | PIN_SD1 =  PIN_SD0 + 1|
| MIC_D2 | 4 | PIN_SD2 =  PIN_SD1 + 1 |
| MIC_D3 | 5 | PIN_SD3 =  PIN_SD2 + 1 |
| LED_CK | 15 | LED_PIN_CLK |
| LED_DA | 14 | LED_PIN_DIN |

VIN of the microphobe should be connected to the 5V of the power supply.
GND of the microphobe should be connected to the GND of the power supply and Raspberry Pi Pico.
Since the library is based on pio functionality, different ports on raspberry pi microcontroller can be used.

GPIO pins are configurable in examples or API.

## Examples

See [examples](examples/) folder.

## Cloning

```sh
git clone 
```

## Building

1. [Set up the Pico C/C++ SDK](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf)
2. Set `PICO_SDK_PATH`
```sh
export PICO_SDK_PATH=/path/to/pico-sdk
```
3. Create `build` dir, run `cmake` and `make`:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. 
make
```
4. Copy example `.uf2` to Pico when in BOOT mode.
